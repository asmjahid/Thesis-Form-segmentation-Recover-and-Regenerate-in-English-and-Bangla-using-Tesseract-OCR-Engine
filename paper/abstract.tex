Protein can be represented by amino acid interaction network. This is a graph whose vertices are the proteins amino acids and whose edges are the interactions between them. This interaction network is the first step of protein’s three-dimensional structure prediction. The network can be predicted using multi-objective evolutionary algorithm and the interaction between amino acid can be confirmed using ant colony algorithm optimization which is a probabilistic optimization algorithm. In this thesis a new multi-objective evolutionary optimization algorithm has been proposed to predict protein secondary structure network using ant colony optimization approach to predict the amino acid interactions.
