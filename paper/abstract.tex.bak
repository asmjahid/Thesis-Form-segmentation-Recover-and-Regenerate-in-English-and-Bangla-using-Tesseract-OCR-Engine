Image segmentation is an important component in many image analysis and computer vision tasks. Particularly, the problem of efficient interactive foreground object segmentation in still images is of great practical importance in image editing and has been the interest of research for a long time. Classical image segmentation tools use either texture, color or edge (contrast) information for the purpose of segmentation. Deformable models, Graph-cut, GrabCut etc. are some prominent methods used for the segmentation of a foreground object. Object segmentation methods have helped in many computer vision areas, such as scene representation \& interpretation, content based image retrieval, object tracking in videos, medical
applications etc.

Most object segmentation techniques in computer vision are based on the principle of boundary detection. These segmentation techniques assume a significant and constant gray level change between the object(s) of interest and the background. However, this is not true in the case of textured images. In textured
images, there exist many local edges of the texture micro units (texels), due to
the basic nature of a texture image. In case of textured images, the object boundary is defined as the place where texture property changes. So to perform the
correct segmentation in case of textured images, there is a need to incorporate the
textural information in the segmentation process.
