First of all, thanks to Almighty Allah for giving us the potency and energy to complete
this thesis successfully.

We want to express out gratefulness towards our thesis supervisor Md. Shiplu Hawlader
for his valuable advices and important suggestions. His regular and active supervision
and erudite directions from the beginning to the end were the driving forces for the
successful completion of the research work.

We would like to convey our thankfulness to all of our teachers at the Department of
Computer Science and Engineering, University of Asia Pacific. Discussions with many
of them have helped us tremendously in improving the quality of our work. We also
thank the department for providing us with resources which were necessary for the
preparation of the thesis.

And last but not the least, we would like to express thanks to our parents and family
members for their tremendous support and inspiration.
