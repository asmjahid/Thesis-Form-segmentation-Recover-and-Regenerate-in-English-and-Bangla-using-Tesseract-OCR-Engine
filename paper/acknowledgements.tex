First of all, thanks to Almighty Allah for giving me the potency and energy to complete this thesis successfully.

I want to express out gratefulness towards my thesis supervisor Dr. Saifuddin Md. Tareeq for his valuable advices and important suggestions. His regular and active supervision and erudite directions from the beginning to the end were the driving forces for the successful completion of the research work. 

I would like to convey my gratitude to all of my teachers at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Dhaka. Discussions with many of them have helped me tremendously in improving the quality of the work. I am particularly thankful to Mr. Mahmudul Hasan and Ashis Kumer Biswas for their valuable suggestions. I also thank the department for providing me with resources which were necessary for the preparation of the thesis.


And last but not the least, I would like to express thanks to my parents and family members for their tremendous support and inspiration.
